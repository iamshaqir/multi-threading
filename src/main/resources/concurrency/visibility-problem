Visibility problem:
-------------------
If one thread changes the data, and it is not visible to other threads Visibility problem occurs,
different threads have different view of the shared data.

This occurs only if multiple threads tries to modify the shared data. If they just read the data it is not an issue.

volatile keyword is used to solve the problem, it ensures that a variable's value is always read directly from main
memory instead of a local cache.

CPU maintains a cache of variable for performance improvements, when multiple threads reads data, they get it from cache,
volatile keyword flushes cache memory and forces CPU to read the latest value from main memory.
